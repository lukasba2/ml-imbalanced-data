# Undersampled Majority Class Ensemble (UMCE) for Data Sampling Methods Comparison

## Overview

This project aims to explore and compare the effectiveness of the Undersampled Majority Class Ensemble method across various data sampling techniques. The Undersampled Majority Class Ensemble is a strategy used in machine learning to address imbalanced datasets, where one class significantly outnumbers the others. By combining undersampling of the majority class with ensemble learning, this approach seeks to improve the model's ability to handle imbalanced data.
